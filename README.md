# Text-Based-Emotion-Detection

# Overview
This project focuses on classifying emotions from text input. It utilizes a dataset of textual descriptions of emotional experiences, each labeled with one of several emotion categories. The model aims to learn from these labeled examples and predict emotions from new text samples.

# Features
Preprocessing of textual data
Multi-class emotion classification
Deep learning model training and evaluation
Performance metrics and visualization

# Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/MandalaMukesh04/text-emotion.git  

- Install dependencies:

- pip install -r requirements.txt  
Run the notebook or script to preprocess data and train the model.

# Dataset
The dataset consists of text samples paired with emotion labels. The labels represent different emotional states such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and guilt. The raw data is in a structured format suitable for training machine learning models. <a href = "https://github.com/MandalaMukesh04/Text-Based-Emotion-Detection/blob/main/textemotion.txt">Dataset View

# Results
The model achieves competitive accuracy on emotion classification tasks. The results include precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, which are visualized using confusion matrices and classification reports.
