# Text-Based Emotion Detection using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Overview
With the increasing reliance on digital communication, understanding human emotions in text is essential for applications in customer feedback analysis, mental health monitoring, sentiment analysis, and chatbot interactions. This project introduces a machine learning-based emotion detection system that classifies text into various emotional categories such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and neutrality.

## Methodology
This project follows a structured approach for text-based emotion classification:
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning text using regular expressions.
- **Feature Extraction**: Creating n-grams for improved text representation.
- **Model Training**: Implementing machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Decision Trees.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy assessment using Scikit-learnâ€™s evaluation functions.

## Data Source
The dataset contains labeled text samples categorized into different emotions. The text data is preprocessed and structured for training using n-gram models. <a href = "https://github.com/MandalaMukesh04/Text-Based-Emotion-Detection/blob/main/textemotion.txt"> **Data Source**
## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core language for text processing.
- **Regular Expressions (`re`)**: Used for text preprocessing and cleaning.
- **Collections (`Counter`)**: Used for feature extraction.
- **Scikit-learn (`sklearn`)**: For machine learning models and evaluation.

## Key Insights
- **Emotion Trends**: Identifying common emotions in different types of text data.
- **Feature Importance**: Understanding the impact of word patterns on emotion classification.
- **Model Performance**: Comparison of different models for emotion detection.

## Applications
This project has various real-world applications, including:
- **Mental Health Monitoring**: AI-based assistance for detecting emotional distress in conversations.
- **Customer Feedback Analysis**: Understanding user sentiment from reviews and feedback.
- **Chatbots & Virtual Assistants**: Enhancing user interaction through emotion-aware responses.
- **Personalized Content Recommendation**: Adapting content based on user emotions.

## Future Enhancements
- **Deep Learning Integration**: Implementing LSTM or Transformer models for improved accuracy.
- **Multi-lingual Support**: Expanding emotion detection to multiple languages.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Enhancing real-time emotion classification for dynamic applications.
